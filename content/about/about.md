this is an off-grid server - a network made for a shared re-imagining of what a network could be.

<!--more-->

dreamnet is a provocation and an invitation - in this space, surrounded by both a legacy and a new tradition of makers of the web, can we think about why we make the things we do? Do we crave connection, resistance, or just creativity? 

The internet was never inevitable, it was crafted messily and ingenuously by humans, some of whom had good intentions, some of whom did not. It's future looks bleak - endless abstractions, privatisation, bots, doomscrolling, fake news. But that is not inevitable either.

We stand on the infrastructure that has been built before us, but that does not need to stop us rebuilding, or to destroy it, or to make something completely different. If you could dream something new, what would that look like?
