## Part 2 - 45 minutes
Collaging and writing - 
We will spend some time now creating three pages of collage and writing for a manifesto zine - what would the internet be if we built it from scratch?
There three questions are the prompts, with a suggestion to use 1 page per prompt:

We will have 15 minutes for each question
1. What would its material architecture be? Where would it be? Who would be building it and maintaining it?
2. What would the process be for engaging with it? Who would be using it, and what would they need to get it to work?
3. What types of material would you share on it? How would it make people act or what emotions would they feel?

Once you have finished we will collect and group them around each question.

## 15 minute break

## Part 3 - 30 mins
Sharing
Together we will look at the pages we’ve made and share the meaning and thoughts behind them.
We will then discuss how we can share the images and ideas with the world.
